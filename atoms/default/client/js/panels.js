                    If the UN sustainable development goal on hunger has been met, food production systems and resilient agricultural practices are reversing losses in productivity and production. Tree planting and revegetation, soil carbon, and emerging methods such as biochar combined with science to reduce animal emissions are strengthening the capacity for adaptation to climate change, extreme weather, drought, flooding and other disasters while progressively improving land and soil quality.
